# 2D Runner Game

A simple 2D platformer game developed using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This game is a part of the final [Team Arcade Project](https://github.com/tonymm55/team-arcade-game) I completed as part of Manchester Codes / Command Shift.

## How to Play

Jump over the incoming slime enemies by using the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the player. You have 3 lives and you lose a life every time you collide with an enemy. The game ends if the player loses all three lives. To restart the game after the game over, the player can press the Enter key.
